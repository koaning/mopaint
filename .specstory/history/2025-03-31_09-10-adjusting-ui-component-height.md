# Adjusting UI Component Height (2025-03-31 11:10:34)

_**User**_

Can we add a little bit of extra height on top? It feels like the blue area on top is missing. @widget.tsx

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you adjust the height of the container to add more space at the top. We'll modify the outer container's height and adjust the inner container's positioning.

```js:draw/widget.tsx
// ... existing code ...
return (
    <div className="bg-teal-600 overflow-hidden" style={{ height: '500px' }}>  {/* Increased from 450px to 500px */}
      <div 
        ref={containerRef}
        className="absolute bg-gray-200 border-2 border-white shadow-md" 
        style={{ width: '800px', height: '450px', left: '50%', top: '60%', transform: 'translate(-50%, -50%)' }}  {/* Changed top from 50% to 60% */}
      >
// ... existing code ...
```

I made two changes:
1. Increased the outer container's height from 450px to 500px to create more space
2. Adjusted the inner container's vertical position from 50% to 60% to move it slightly lower, creating more visible blue space above

The rest of the code remains unchanged. This should give you more of that classic Windows-style blue background area above the paint window.

That did not help, try again?

_**Assistant**_

Let me try a different approach. Looking at the screenshot, we need to increase the height of the Paint window itself.

```js:js/draw/widget.tsx
// ... existing code ...
const Component() {
  // ... existing code ...
  return (
    <div className="bg-teal-600 overflow-hidden" style={{ height: '500px' }}>
      <div 
        ref={containerRef}
        className="absolute bg-gray-200 border-2 border-white shadow-md" 
        style={{ width: '800px', height: '500px', left: '50%', top: '50%', transform: 'translate(-50%, -50%)' }}  {/* Changed height from 450px to 500px */}
      >
// ... existing code ...
```

I changed:
1. Increased both the outer container and Paint window height from 450px to 500px, which should give more vertical space for all the elements, including the title bar area.

Let me know if this helps achieve the look you're going for!
